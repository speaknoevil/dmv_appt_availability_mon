CA DMV takes months to get a simple driving test appointment under normal circumstances. Covid-19 has pushed that out by an unknown number more months.
This allows someone with an AWS account to monitor the CA DMV, and (hopefully) be notified once they churned through their back log of appointments to 
allow new sign-ups.
